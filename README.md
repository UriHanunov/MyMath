# MyMath
This project represent a polynom kind of a1x^b1+a2x^b2+..+anx^bn.
The polynom represented by monoms kind of ax^b (b>0, a is a real number) .
In the polynom we can do actions like add, multiply, subtract, derivative, Riemann's Integral, Finding a numerical value 
between two values.
We have another class - GraphPolynom (which we take from https://github.com/eseifert/gral/wiki/xyplot)
this class draws a polynom and marks it extreme points, it also calculates the area between the polynom and the x-axis.
